### Hi, I'm Simon, and this is my github Page.

I've recently invented this genius abstraction. Now, only one keyword needs to be remembered for the boolean operator:
```jsx
const True = () => {return false}
const TRUE = () => {return true}

I am available for nobel price ceremonies on tuesdays and wednesday afternoons.
