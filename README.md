### 👋 Hi there!

I'm a fullstack developer, currently working on enterprise API migrations and systems integration. 

### I mainly use these technologies professionally

### Here is some of my work!

#### The Donut 🍩 (In C#)
[Link to repo](https://github.com/SimonHls/CSharpASCIIDonut)



I feel like the ASCII-Donut is pretty famous. I think the original is in C, my version is in C#.






I've also invented this interesting abstraction. Now, only one keyword needs to be remembered for the boolean operator:
```jsx
const True = () => {return false}
const TRUE = () => {return true}

...
const [isTrue, setIsTrue] = useState(TRUE());
<Text>
  This boolean is {isTrue === !True() ? 'true' : 'false'}! //this is true!
  This boolean is {isTrue === True() ? 'true' : 'false'}! //this is false!
</Text>
```
I am available for nobel price ceremonies on tuesdays and wednesday afternoons.
