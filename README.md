### 👋 Hi there, I'm Simon!

I'm a fullstack developer, currently working in enterprise API development in ASP.NET Core. 

## Technologies 🛠

### I mainly use these technologies

## Here is some of my work!

### The Donut 🍩 (In C#)

<img src="https://github.com/SimonHls/SimonHls/raw/main/donut.png" width="300" align="left" />

A rotating donut, spinning around the Z and Y-axis. The animation is played in the command line using ASCII-characters to indicate brightness.

This project is my implementation of the math described in [this article.](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html)

### Linear Optimization

<img src="https://github.com/SimonHls/SimonHls/raw/main/network.png" width="300" align="left" />

A collection of linear optimization problems, solved using linear programming and Googles OR-Tools library. Linear programming is a way of optimally solving optimization problems such as TSPs or shopfloor scheduling. 

This project is written primarily in python.
